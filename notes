End of day 08.23.24

Productive day, was able to carve about 6 hours out, not as much as I had ideally wanted, but life. 
Did a lot of database research, have my seed and schema done, and tables maybe done? Maybe just sketched? 
Watched through 3 class videos, but it was really good review and reminded me of some things. 
Plants class base model done, should be ready to accept some data once I get my ends working. 
Front end is up, and running, no work done yet. Just an empty page ready for dreams.
