End of day 08.23.24

Productive day, was able to carve about 6 hours out, not as much as I had ideally wanted, but life. 
Did a lot of database research, have my seed and schema done, and tables maybe done? Maybe just sketched? 
Watched through 3 class videos, but it was really good review and reminded me of some things. 
Plants class base model done, should be ready to accept some data once I get my ends working. 
Front end is up, and running, no work done yet. Just an empty page ready for dreams.

    I think I should sink some time post Dday into sessions. I thought it was auth related, but I think it is also database, 
    maybe mostly, database related. 

    Alright. Way too much timme lost on database and backend. Claude thinks it's something with my database link, which kinda makes more sense. 
    need to find that class video, MORE REVIEW! 
    Tailwind. 
    
    Actively trying not to throw up. Terrible day, I am realizing just how much the fire hydrant was unsuccessful. Wow. 
    I truly cannot wait till I can just learn, and not die trying to learn from 4 fire hydrants before Wednesday.

    I think Week 13 Day 1 is a good rewatch video. Lots of backend of shrinkray, when we were working with links before we started using the #docs screen
    delving deep in to videos, my action of getting a new plant isn't rendering me a query to actually enter the information, no idea why. UGH. 
    ARRRRRRGGHH THERE IS NO WEEK 13 DAY 2 VIDEO!
    Finally. Week 15, Day 1, 2 hours 13 minutes is FastApi docs
    Wow I don't remember Bruno AT ALL. 

    Alright. I have tried everything. Still will not give me queries. I tried colons (like in the class code-along), nothing. the github example, nothing. Mattermost website, nothing.
