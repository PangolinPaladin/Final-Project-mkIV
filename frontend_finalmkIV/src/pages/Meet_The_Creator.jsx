          Greetings! My relationship with plants goes back many years to college.
          Not a positive time for me, I struggled being trapped inside a sterilized, blue-lit, desert,
          and suffered mentally, until I happened upon the manager of Lowes one afternoon. 

          Clearancing the plants, she offered me to choose anything I fancied, and clearanced it down to a dollar (about 25% value)!
          Having life in my dorm, and later apartment, brought joy.

          Now a decade later, my collection has grown, and exclusively from the clearance rack and dumpster, taking home the 
          broken, abused, drowned, and burnt to give them a second chance at life. 

          I started this project because I believe there is a fantastic market available, but also because I was looking for 
          something like this, and nothing I found exisiting quite fit. 

          I hope this proves useful to you, and helps you keep your photosynthesizing friends happy!
